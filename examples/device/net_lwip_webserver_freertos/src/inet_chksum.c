/**
 * @file
 *
 * This file provides a workaround for incorrect checksum calculation
 * when size optimization is enabled in the GCC compiler.
 *
 * The checksum calculation function was copied without modification
 * from the original lwip/src/inet_chksum.c. A compiler optimization
 * attribute has been applied to ensure it is always compiled with the -O3 flag.
 * This issue no longer reproduces with GCC 14.x.
 *
 * If you create your own version, link it in and in your cc.h put:
 *
 * \#define LWIP_CHKSUM your_checksum_routine
